Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each circleci.py release.

Version 1.2.2
-------------

.. note::
    What happened to 1.2.0 and 1.2.1?

    Due to a bug in the SDK, these releases has been unpublished from pypi. The
    bug was an issue in the build_singleton logic that did not exclude the
    current build, therefore putting us into an infinite loop. Ironically, I
    did not test this on CircleCI so this is why the bug was not found in
    testing. Since pypi does not allow re-publishing versions (for good reason)
    I had to unpublish 1.2.0 and 1.2.1

    In the future, I may start to use the -dev publishing model to try to verify
    this behavior ahead of time.
